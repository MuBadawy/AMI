\section*{\# Stay at home --- Are Germany's greenhouse gas emissions increasing or decreasing}

Besides the current Covid-19 issue the population of the whole world is facing the climate change. Almost all human activities lead to or cause greenhouse gas emissions, which drive up the temperature. Extreme weather and melting polar ice are other possible effects.\\

The government of Germany has decided on multiple restrictions changing our daily life. The goal of this research question is to analyse these drastic changes and identify which behavior is causing a decrease in emissions and therefore help us to reach the Paris climate agreement.
